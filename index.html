    <h2>Why this Course?</h2>
       My reasons for taking this class is numerous: 
       <ul>
        <li>I bought a domain name years ago with the intention of building a portfolio site to host my writing. I took a summer to learn the basics of HTML and CSS, but it turns out that I am not as intrinsically motivated as I thought I was, so taking this class for credit towards my Master’s is a great incentive to get started!</li>
        <li>My two main work backgrounds are rooted in supporting information-seeking behaviors. At UW-Madison’s Libraries, I manage internal documentation for our student employees. In addition, as a tutor, I've crafted study guides for students to supplement their lecture notes. Using skills learned from this course, I hope to make the finest of wikis and knowledgebases!</li>
        <li> A librarian with a STEM background is hard to come by in the job market. This is something I would like to use to my advantage by picking up some technical skills during the course of my degree program.</li>
       </ul>  
       <h2>Planned Content:</h2>
       <ul>
        <li>About Me, Career Journey, and Resume for my vanity site</li>
        <li>Any additional pages for course assignments</li>
        <li>A section for my Mom’s Recipes, for the final project</li>
