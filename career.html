        <h2 id="careerpath">Career Path</h2>
        <p>If I were to write a novel about my career journey, it would be about discovering the different interior people within us and finding ways to build a career where all of these strengths can come to the forefront. As a result, I have a sort of non-traditional career path where I am not directly using the degree and skills I gained in college, but have goals of tying everything together eventually.</p>

    <p>I completed my undergrad at the University of Redlands from 2016 to 2020. They say college is a place where you plant seeds. Through the variety of experiences and extracurriculars, I ended up planting three:</p>

                <p>I pursued a <strong>Bachelor's of Science in Chemistry</strong>, where I had the opportunity to do a research project on the topics of Environmental Chemistry and Microbiology.

    <p>After graduating, I relocated to Eugene, Oregon from 2020 to 2023. These were the years I consider my wandering years, but I am immensely grateful for the hard lessons I learned here. Despite it being a relatively small city, I was lucky to find three different part-time jobs that fit my 3 interests:</p>

                <p>Utilizing my degree, I served as the designated math and sciences subject specialist. I tutored in algebra, geometry, pre-calculus, calculus, statistics, chemistry, and physics classes. On a personal level, I <strong>mentored</strong> and build relations with students between 6th grade to college by identifying learning strengths, creating lesson plans, and building confidence in <strong>STEM</strong>. During the summers, I taught SAT and GRE prep classes for those subjects.</p>

I supported day-to-day transactions, like circulating material and registering library cards while upholding and communicating library procedures.

I relocated (once again!) for this exciting opportunity to interact with library systems and communities as both a student and a working professional. The variety and freedom I am given here have allowed me to incorporate the strengths I have built more closely:</p>
