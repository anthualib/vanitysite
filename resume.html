    <h2>Undergrad in Redlands, California</h2>
      <p>I did my undergrad degree at the University of Redlands from 2016 to 2020. They say college is a place where you plant seeds. Having the opportunity to explore my interests broader, I ended up planting three:<p>
       <div class= sixtythirty center>
        <div class="column column-33">
          <h3>Interest 1:<br>STEM</h3>
          <p>I pursued a <strong>Bachelors of Science in Chemistry</strong>, where I had the opportunity to do a research project on the topics of Environmental Chemistry and Microbiology. My research thesis allowed me to study microbial breakdown of long-range pollutants in glacial reservoirs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column column-33">
          <h3>Interest 2:<br>Mentorship</h3>
           <p>I was heavily involved in <strong>Students Together Empowering Peers (STEP)</strong>, a mentorship program that helped first-gen students of color transition into college and adult life. Along these lines, I also worked as a <strong>Peer Tutor</strong>, and assisted students in Gen and Organic Chemistry.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column column-33">
          <h3>Interest 3:<br>Libraries</h3>
          <p>I worked as a <strong>Student Assistant at my University&#8217;s Library</strong>. This was a front desk role that leveraged my long history in and love of customer service. I was eventually promoted to a <strong>Student Lead</strong> position, which allowed me to take on project-based work, and leadership roles.</p>

<div><h2>Gap year(s) in Eugene, Oregon</h2>
      <p>After graduating, I relocated to Eugene, Oregon from 2020 to 2023. Despite it being a relatively small city, I was lucky to find three different part-time jobs that fit my 3 interests:<p>
       <div class= sixtythirty center>
        <div class="column column-33">
          <h3>Job 1:<br>Professional STEM Tutor for a Private Company</h3>
          <p>Utilizing degree, I served as the designated math and sciences subject specialist. I tutored in algebra, geometry, pre-calculus, calculus, statistics, chemistry, and physics classes. On a personal level, I <strong>mentored</strong> and build relations with students between 6th grade to college by identifying learning strengths, creating lesson plans, and building confidence in <strong>STEM</strong>. During the summers, I taught SAT and GRE prep classes for those subjects.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column column-33">
          <h3>Job 2:<br>Resource Center Staff at Lane Community College</h3>
           <p>The <strong>STEM</strong> Learning Zone is the department resource center located within the Math, Science, and Engineering (SME) department. I am proud to have served as part of the team that revitalized the center after it had closed during COVID and <strong>mentored</strong> students as they transitioned back into an in-person learning environment. We achieved a culture of reliability and inclusivity to meet the needs of a new generation of learners. Some of my responsibilities here included running our proctoring services and managing the department <strong>library</strong>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column column-33">
          <h3>Job 3:<br>Assistant at Springfield Public Library</h3>
          <p>As an on-call <strong>library</strong> staff, I filled gaps in coverage to provide consistent services for the city&#8217;s diverse population. I supported day-to-day transactions, like circulating material and registering library cards while upholding and communicating library procedures. Catering to the needs of our community, I also guided and instructed patrons on essential, technology-based resources, like the use of online catalogs and computer software.</p>

    <div><h2>Grad School in Madison, WI</h2>
      <p>In Summer 2023, I get an offer for a full-time job at the <strong>University of Madison – Wisconsin</strong>, a school that offered a <strong>Master’s in Library and Information</strong>. I relocated– once again– for this exciting opportunity to interact with library systems and communities as both a student and a working professional. In the context of the seeds, the job allows me the freedom to explore my three interests through different roles I play in the workplace:<p>
       <div class= sixtythirty center>
        <div class="column column-33">
          <h3>Role 1:<br>???</h3>
          <p>As of now, the STEM slot remains unfilled. Due to campus-wide internal restructuring, there are possible opportunities to reincorporate STEM into my current role. But that is only for the future to tell!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column column-33">
          <h3>Role 2:<br>Student Coordinator and Supervisor</h3>
           <p>At Memorial Library, I oversee more than 45 student workers across our two service desks. Having started off as a student worker myself, the mentorship role had come full circle as pass along the torch to the next generation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column column-33">
          <h3>Role 3:<br>Circulation Specialist</h3>
          <p>Working in the Public Services department means that I handle everything regarding access– circulation, accounts, fines. I also serve as the nights and weekend closing supervisor for Memorial Library.</p>
