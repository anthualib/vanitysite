    <h2>Work with Me</h2>
    
    <p>A study estimates that 90 percent of students in universities experience issues due to academic stress, future planning, mental health. However, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25650824/">only 15 percent of students</a> reported actually seeking help. As a longtime information specialist and aspiring librarian, I aim to make finding support more accessible. I have a core philosophy that small but thoughtful actions can make biggest changes. Though my work, I hope to manifest this by being invested and present for those seeking guidance.</p>
